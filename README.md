ilc
=========

**So... what is this thing?**

ilc is *supposed to be* a library to work with common IRC log formats, as well as a collection
of commonly needed utilities for IRC logs.

**Supposed to be? What can it do for me now?**

The library can convert between most of the EnergyMech and Weechat3 log formats.
The tools can pretty-print them, and count the lines/words that people said in them.
They're not really configurable yet, so you'd have to recompile it for that... <sup><sup>yesiknowitsucks</sup></sup>

**Are you stupid? Why Rust?**

Uhh, actually... that may have been a suboptimal choice. Nobody cares about performance here
anyways. But it was what I started with, and I didn't feel like rewriting it.
